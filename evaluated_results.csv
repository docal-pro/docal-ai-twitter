Crypto desperately needs a promising new L1 to compete w Sol - User interface. Hyperliquid is optimized for what we really want to do in crypto - trade. No jupiter, phantom wallet, trading bots. It's all on hyperliquid's front end or you can make trades on telegram with pvp(dot)trade - talent. hyperliquid's builders are extremely talented evidenced by if you spend 1 hour researching the projects on there. their pump fun competitor for example, hypurrfun, is not a pumpfun copypasta. it has fresh features, fresh ideas, new take - attention. i spoke to my friend bry who's project infinigods bought ticker GOD on hyperliquid for $1m usd. the case for them is clear. gamefi projects like infinigods can't practically get listed on binance or t1 anymore. there's too much hassle with it. so instead, they buy a fire ticker on hyperliquid, and attract that level of attention and capital with a splash of a ticker purchase. infinigods would have been just another project on solana. now, they will be the premier gamefi project on there and attract tons of liquidity from the HL dex (that's a lot of pros but here are some cons to the trade) Cons - the future L1 might be overvalued right now. it's really just one big app-chain rn so a $100bn fdv would be high - users are high net worth, techy, and nerdy. narrative is not as ripe for giga rip as Solana imo, which “appeals to retail” - future unlocks of around 40% of the supply can dilute the token. this will take many years tho - another ""next hyperliquid"" coming out to steal the narrative which imo is unlikely @frankdegods: hyperliquid",$HYPE,bullish,token,hyperliquid,28.218793897378536,24.7,-12.469682120983295,41,
